    "## Essential Basic Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/overview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data, but most of the time we use it for **tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns**, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that Pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN)\n",
    "- Automatic and explicit data alignment\n",
    "- Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "- Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "- Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging, etc"

    "\n",
    "- **Series**\t1D labeled homogeneously-typed array\n",
    "    - Container for scalars or strings\n",
    "    - Each one has an index and potentially a name\n",
    "- **DataFrame**\tGeneral 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously-typed column\n",
    "    - Container for Series\n",
    "    - Overall index, and each Series (column) has a name\n",
    "\n",
    "**We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column.**"
