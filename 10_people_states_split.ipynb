    "## Tidy data with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is the Python module that lets you efficiently deal with tabular data, which is data in columns, where each column has a certain type, and each row is a specific record of that combination of columns of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can do many things, but what I end up using it for most often is to load in and manipulate data that I want to transform for another program, or that I want to run machine learning routines on. Those manipulations can be cleaning, joining with other data tables, or changing the form so that it's \"tidy\" or \"tall\", which is required for programs like Tableau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadley Wickham, who is very influential in the R world, wrote [this paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) spelling out what \"tidy\" data is. There was also a [recent blog post](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html) showing how to do many of those examples using Python and Pandas, which taught me a lot. From that post:\n",

    "#### Defining tidy data\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure Wickham defines as tidy has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each variable forms a column and contains values\n",
    "* Each observation forms a row\n",
    "* Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
    "\n",
    "A few definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable: A measurement or an attribute. Height, weight, sex, etc.\n",
    "* Value: The actual measurement or attribute. 152 cm, 80 kg, female, etc.\n",
    "* Observation: All values measure on the same unit. Each person.\n"
